Parts Used In the Video:

From Amazon:

-- Arduino: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J1X5B7Y/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

-- Logic Coverter: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0148BLZGE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

-- Male to Male Wires: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD3JVHD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

-- Heatshrink Kit: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QM8249H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

-- x2 Buttons: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWQ9YN5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

.. These buttons suck, but they are very cheap. You'll need to order two sets to get 20; however, I don't reccommend using these cause there are way better ones out there.

-- Chessboard: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0198737KU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

.. I would reccomend looking for a sturdier boardl; however, this is box is relatievly cheap and is the perfect size.

From FocusAttack:

-- 30 connection .110 DaisyChain: (https://focusattack.com/30-connection-22-awg-110-ground-daisy-chain-wire/)
  
-- x2 16pc .110 QDC wires: (https://focusattack.com/blue-16pc-22-awg-wire-with-110-quick-disconnect/)
  

Parts I had on hand:
  
-- Spare gamecube controller
  
-- Drill
  
-- 15/16" Spade Drill bit
  
-- Ligther
  
-- Soldering Iron (w/Solder)

.. I used a super cheap one I found in my dads garage. If It burns it works as far as I can tell.
