Parts Used In the Video:

Arduino: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J1X5B7Y/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Logic Coverter: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0148BLZGE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Male to Male Wires: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD3JVHD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Buttons: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWQ9YN5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
These buttons suck, but they are very cheap. You'll need to order two sets to get 20; however, I don't reccommend using these cause there are way better ones out there.

Chessboard: (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0198737KU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
I would reccomend looking for a sturdier boardl; however, this is box is relatievly cheap and is the perfect size.
